# Chefventory

Why This Project?
Restaurants often struggle with food wastage and inventory theft. Ingredients expire before
use, and staff may misuse stock. Manual systems make tracking slow and error-prone.
Chefventory is an inventory management system built with OOP concepts to help
restaurants reduce food wastage and protect inventory privacy.


Goals of the Project
- Reduce Food Wastage through expiry tracking, stock monitoring, and consumption
analysis.
- Protect Inventory Privacy by restricting staff access and using activity logs.
- Apply OOP concepts
- - Encapsulation – Keep ingredient data secure.
- - Inheritance – Differentiate roles (Admin, Staff).
- - Polymorphism – Orders can handle both dishes and custom ingredients.
- - Abstraction – Dashboard shows only alerts and insights.
- - Composition – Dishes contain ingredients, Inventory manages ingredients.
- Deliver a working system with a simple dashboard and role-based access.
